    * It would be incredibly useful if we could use sumSquare with parameters that
    * were either in a monad or not in a monad at all. This would allow us to abstract
    * over monadic and non-monadic code.
    *
    * Fortunately, Cats provides the Id type to bridge the gap:

  /**
    * Id is actually a type alias that turns an atomic type into a single-parameter
    * type constructor. We can cast any value of any type to a corresponding Id.
    *
    * {{{
    *   package cats
    *   type Id[A] = A
    * }}}
    *
    * The ability to abstract over monadic and non-monadic code is extremely powerful.
    * For example, we can run code asynchronously in production using Future
    * and synchronously in test using Id.
